Write a while loop that is initialized at 0 and stops at 15. If the counter is an even number, append the counter to a list called eve_nums.

eve_nums=[]
n=0
while(n<15):
    if n%2==0:
        eve_nums.append(n)
    n=n+1
    
Below, weâ€™ve provided a for loop that sums all the elements of list1. Write code that accomplishes the same task, but instead uses a while loop. Assign the accumulator variable to the name accum.

list1 = [8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

accum = 0
i=0
while (i<len(list1)):
    accum= accum+list1[i]
    i =i+1
    
    
    
    Write a function called stop_at_four that iterates through a list of numbers. Using a while loop, append each number to a new list until the number 4 appears. The function should return the new list.


def stop_at_four(b):
    a=[]
    i=0
    while(i<len(b)):
        if (b[i]==4):
            break
        a.append(b[i])
        i =i+1
    return a
        
stop_at_four([1,2,3,4,5])
