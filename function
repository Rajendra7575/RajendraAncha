Write a program that extracts the last three items in the list sports and assigns it to the variable last. Make sure to write your code so that it works no matter how many items are in the list.

def a (s):
    last = [sports[-3],sports[-2],sports[-1]]
    return last
sports = ['cricket', 'football', 'volleyball', 'baseball', 'softball', 'track and field', 'curling', 'ping pong', 'hockey']
last=a(sports)
print(last)
