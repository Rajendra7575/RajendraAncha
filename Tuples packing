2. Create a tuple called practice that has four elements: ‘y’, ‘h’, ‘z’, and ‘x’.

practice =('y','h','z','x')


3. Create a tuple named tup1 that has three elements: ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.

tup1 ='a','b','c'


4. Provided is a list of tuples. Create another list called t_check that contains the third element of every tuple.


lst_tups = [('Articuno', 'Moltres', 'Zaptos'), ('Beedrill', 'Metapod', 'Charizard', 'Venasaur', 'Squirtle'), ('Oddish', 'Poliwag', 'Diglett', 'Bellsprout'), ('Ponyta', "Farfetch'd", "Tauros", 'Dragonite'), ('Hoothoot', 'Chikorita', 'Lanturn', 'Flaaffy', 'Unown', 'Teddiursa', 'Phanpy'), ('Loudred', 'Volbeat', 'Wailord', 'Seviper', 'Sealeo')]
t_check=[]
for i in lst_tups:
    t_check +=[i[2]]

5. Below, we have provided a list of tuples. Write a for loop that saves the second element of each tuple into a list called seconds.


tups = [('a', 'b', 'c'), (8, 7, 6, 5), ('blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red'), (5.6, 9.99, 2.5, 8.2), ('squirrel', 'chipmunk')]
seconds =[]
for i in tups:
    seconds +=[i[1]]
    
    
    
    
    
    Tuples asReturn Values
    
    
    Define a function called information that takes as input, the variables name, birth_year, fav_color, and hometown. It should return a tuple of these variables in this order.

def information(name,birth_year,fav_color,hometown):
    name = name
    birth_year= birth_year
    fav_color = fav_color
    hometown= hometown
    return name,birth_year,fav_color,hometown
print(information("gopal","5-7-98","red","gjdfv"))



Define a function called info with the following required parameters: name, age, birth_year, year_in_college, and hometown. The function should return a tuple that contains all the inputted information.


def info(name,age,birth_year,year_in_college,hometown):
    name= name
    age =age
    birth_year=birth_year
    year_in_college = year_in_college
    hometown= hometown
    return name,age,birth_year,year_in_college,hometown
print (info("Rajenda","25","5-7-1996","2014","Martur"))
