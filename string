Write code to create a list of word lengths for the words in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_words_list. (You should use the len function).




original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox"
num_words_list= []
for i in original_str.split():
    
    num_words_list.append(len(i))
    
    
    
    output:
    Result	Actual Value	Expected Value	Notes
Pass	[3, 5...4, 3]	[3, 5...4, 3]	Testing whether num_words_list has the correct value
Pass	'for'	'origi...n(i))'	Testing that you are using a for loop in your code.
You passed: 100.0% of the tests
